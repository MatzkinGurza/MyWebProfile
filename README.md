# Mateus Matzkin Gurza Web Profile
### This Repo was used for the project of developing my own web profile page

The web profile must contain my relevant social medias, my contact information, some description of myself and my curriculum vitae, both the portuguese versio and english version<br>
The framework used to build the true website was HUGO. Other than learning the HUGO framework, HTML and CSS were programming languages/hardskills learned and developed in this project.
---
Here is a quick description of the file structure of the project:
- _MyHugoSite_ contains the whole file system associated with the framework and represents the true site to be published.
- _MyWebProfile_ is a playground for testing out initial ideas of how to put the site together
- _Documentos_ & _Imagens_ are redunduncies of information contained in the static folder inside _MyHugoSite_
- All other files are supporting files for the previously mentioned ones
