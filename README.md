# Mateus Matzkin Gurza Web Profile
### This Repo was used for the project of developing my own web profile page

The web profile must contain my relevant social medias, my contact information, some description of myself and my curriculum vitae, both the portuguese versio and english version

##### The framework used to build the true website was HUGO. Other than learning the HUGO framework, HTML and CSS were programming languages/hardskills learned and developed in this project.
---
Here is a quick description of the file structure of the project:
- _MyHugoSite_ contains the whole file system associated with the framework and represents the true site to be published.
- _documents_ contains my Curriculum Vitae
- _images_ contains the png, jpeg and jpg files associated with the site
- there is nothing inside the _themes_ folder because the theme was fully developed from scratch
- _layouts_ contains an _experience_ and a _schooling_ folder wich have their own single pages
- _content_ contains all text files in markdown
- All other files are supporting files for the previously mentioned ones
